Assalamalaikum Sir Zia and Faculty,

Myself Abdullah Rafeeq. I wanted to convey that I have completed 10 questions from the TypeScript assignment. Although this is a modest start, I am committed to improving my skills steadily over time. I believe that with dedication and practice, I will be able to tackle more questions in the future.

On a related note, I want to highlight that while I may have completed only 10 questions in TypeScript, I am proficient in Python and confident in my ability to solve all 45 questions in Python.

Thank you for your guidance and support as I continue my learning journey.

Best regards,
Abdullah Rafeeq.
